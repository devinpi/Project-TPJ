<h3>Some things about the Project</h3>
<p>In response to the security concern, we have designed a surveillance system to identify any unsafe intrusion in a building using a PIR motion sensor. The pi camera module is used to capture still images and takes high-definition videos.<br><br> Any unusual activity can be tracked down since the recorded information is stored in a well-defined database which can be procured at any given time by the user. The arrangement makes use of a Raspberry Pi 3B+ as the central control unit and displays the information on a computer screen. Furthermore, it is contained inside a predetermined size and can be started from a PC.<br><br>
A Python and PHP script will be running on the Raspberry Pi which will be actively interfacing with the LAMP server on the device. The Raspberry Pi will be operating on an Apache web server, made accessible using its IP address, to host our website.<br><br> 
This system is ideal for ordinary individuals wishing to update their home security because of its inexpensive cost, minimal power consumption and low maintenance requirements.
