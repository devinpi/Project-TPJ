# Project-TPJ

## Introduction:
This proposal aims at delivering a motion detection solution utilising Raspberry Pi and PIR Motion Detection Sensors to address residential and corporate security challenges. The Raspberry Pi is a little computer that can be plugged into a computer monitor or any other display and be operated with the use of a keyboard and mouse. 
PIR Sensors, or passive infrared sensors, are small devices that aid in motion detection. The system will incorporate a Pi camera which would capture an image/video of the person at the entrance and upload the same to a local database which can be accessed by a user at any given time. The recorded data can be extracted from the database to display the details on a computer screen.
Such a system can be installed at automatic doorways, house entrances, private room entryways,etc to ensure safety and aid people in tracking down any mishaps.


## Functional Features of the Project
The project has 4 main hardware components. They include Raspberry Pi, PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, Pi camera module. It also includes a monitor for reviewing the logged information.
 
### Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi will be our main MCU that will handle all the processing. It will take care of the inputs from the PIR motion sensor and use that to capture or record the surroundings using the Pi camera. 
A (T-shaped) Raspberry Pi GPIO extension board will be connected to the breadboard facilitating the components to be connected to the breadboard directly.
It will also act as a local database device responsible for storing the data captured from the camera and further making that information available to view on a Web Page.  

### Input Device: Raspberry Pi Camera Module
The camera is connected to the pi using the camera module port on the Pi using a ribbon cable. 
The image captured is stored on the Raspberry Pi SD card. 

### Input Device: Adafruit PIR Motion Sensor
PIR motion sensor is used to sense the motion in the surroundings that fall in the sensorâ€™s range. 
As the motion is detected, that signal is sent to Pi. An LED is also set up to indicate any motion. Following this the camera takes the image.
 
### Output Device: Desktop Monitor
The monitor is used to operate the Web Based application that will contain all the information from the sensors. 
The monitor will be connected to Pi using an HDMI cable.
